            screen. You can login and verify the order on the Order History page.
            If any issues with the order you can write an email to wethecakepoint@gmail.com
            The operations team will contact you through the mobile number provided to confirm the
            delivery requirements such as order details, delivery location, time, etc. The operations team will
            confirm the possible time of delivery based on the order pipeline, location of delivery, and other
            reasons.
            If there are any issues with the required conversation, you can write an email to
            wethecakepoint@gmail.com to register your complaint.
            The order will be delivered to the mentioned address in the order. If there is no one to receive
            the order, your product may be returned and no refund will be made. We offer the best price
            including delivery charges as mentioned in the order, and hence not much room is available for
            operational challenges such as non-availability of customers at the time of delivery or
            inaccessible locations. Any delays due to unavoidable reasons such as roadblocks, lockdowns,
            traffic, flooding, etc will be communicated to the customer at the time of delivery if the delivery
            team sees any possibilities of delivery delays.
            If any issues with the delivery made, you can write an email to wethecakepoint@gmail.com to
            register your complaint.
            The delivery slot will be mutually agreed upon by the customer and operations team of The
            Cake Point.
            We deliver to all locations in Chennai and Pondicherry. If for any reason, a particular area is
            non-serviceable due to distance from the nearest outlet or factor, the same will be
            communicated to the customer at the time of gathering requirements. If the customer is not
            interested to pay additional delivery charges, then the customer can cancel the order and
            request a full refund.
            If there are any issues with the delivery or order confirmations, you can write an email to
            wethecakepoint@gmail.com to register your complaint.
            We are enhancing the site to provide more notifications and status on order fulfillment, which
            will be available in the future.`
